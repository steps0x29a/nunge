# nunge

`nunge` is a nim rewrite of the OG `munge` by [Th3S3cr3tAg3nt](https://github.com/Th3S3cr3tAg3nt/Munge).

This program is *heavily* inspired by the original munge, but adds its own twists to the inner workings as well as a few more levels of detail to the wordlist generation process.

Credits go to [Th3S3cr3tAg3nt](https://github.com/Th3S3cr3tAg3nt) for their work on the original `munge`.

`nunge` was written in ðŸ‘‘ nim by [steps0x29a](https://github.com/steps0x29a) and is licensed under the MIT license.
